# changelog

This file contains highlights of what changes on each version of the polymer
package. We will also note important changes to the polyfill packages (observe,
web_components, and template_binding) if they impact polymer.

#### Pub version 0.12.2+1
  * Small bug fix for `polymer:new_element`

#### Pub version 0.12.2
  * Fix for [20539](http://dartbug.com/20539). Log widget will now html escape
    messages.
  * Fix for [20538](http://dartbug.com/20538). Log widget will now surface lint
    logs from imported files.
  * Backward compatible change to prepare for upcoming change of the user agent
    in Dartium.
  * `pub run polymer:new_element` now supports specifying a base class.
    **Note**: only native DOM types and custom elements written in Dart can be
    extended. Elements adapted from Javascript (like core- and paper- elements)
    cannot be extended.
  * other bug fixes in `polymer:new_entry`.

#### Pub version 0.12.1
  * **New**: When running in pub-serve, any warnings and errors detected by the
    polymer transformers will be displayed in the lower-right corner of your
    entrypoint page. You can opt-out by adding this option to your pubspec:

        transformers:
        - polymer:
            ...
            inject_build_logs_in_output: false

  * **New**: there are now two template generators in the polymer package! On
    any project that depends on polymer, you can create template files for a new
    custom element by invoking:

        pub run polymer:new_element element-name [-o output_dir]

    And, if you invoke:

        pub run polymer:new_entry web/index.html

    we will create a new entry-point file and add it to your pubspec for you.

  * Added the ability to override the stylesheet inlining behavior. There is now
    an option exposed in the pubspec.yaml called `inline_stylesheets`. There are
    two possible values, a boolean or a map. If only a boolean is supplied then
    that will set the global default behavior. If a map is supplied, then the
    keys should be file paths, and the value is a boolean. You can use the
    special key 'default' to set the default value.

    For example, the following would change the default to not inline any
    styles, except for the foo.css file in your web folder and the bar.css file
    under the foo packages lib directory:

        transformers:
        - polymer:
            ...
            inline_stylesheets:
                default: false
                web/foo.css: true
                packages/foo/bar.css: true

    
  * Bug fix for http://dartbug.com/20286. Bindings in url attributes will no
    longer throw an error.


#### Pub version 0.12.0+7
  * Widen the constraint on `unittest`.

#### Pub version 0.12.0+6
  * Widen the constraint on analyzer.
  * Support for `_src` and similar attributes in polymer transformers.

#### Pub version 0.12.0+5
  * Raise the lower bound on the source_maps constraint to exclude incompatible
    versions.

#### Pub version 0.12.0+4
  * Widen the constraint on source_maps.

#### Pub version 0.12.0+3
  * Fix a final use of `getLocationMessage`.

#### Pub version 0.12.0+2
  * Widen the constraint on barback.

#### Pub version 0.12.0+1
  * Switch from `source_maps`' `Span` class to `source_span`'s `SourceSpan`
    class.

#### Pub version 0.12.0
 * Updated to match polymer 0.3.4 ([polymer-dev#6ad2d61][6ad2d61]), this
   includes the following changes:
     * added @ComputedProperty
     * @published can now be written using the readValue/writeValue helper
       methods to match the same timing semantics as Javscript properties.
     * underlying packages are also updated. Some noticeable changes are:
       * observe: path-observers syntax is slightly different
       * polymer_expressions: updating the value of an expression will issue a
         notification.
       * template_binding: better NodeBind interop support (for
         two-way bindings with JS polymer elements).
 * Several fixes for CSP, including a cherry-pick from polymer.js
   [commit#3b690ad][3b690ad].
 * Fix for [17596](https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=17596)
 * Fix for [19770](https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=19770)

#### Pub version 0.11.0+5
  * fixes web_components version in dependencies

#### Pub version 0.11.0+4
  * workaround for bug
    [19653](https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=19653)

#### Pub version 0.11.0+3
  * update readme

#### Pub version 0.11.0+2
  * bug fix: event listeners were not in the dirty-checking zone
  * bug fix: dispatch event in auto-binding

#### Pub version 0.11.0+1
  * Added a workaround for bug in HTML imports (issue
    [19650](https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=19650)).

#### Pub version 0.11.0
  * **breaking change**: platform.js and dart_support.js must be specified in
    your entry points at the beginning of `<head>`.
  * **breaking change**: polymer.html is not required in entrypoints, but it is
    required from files that use `<polymer-element>`.
  * **breaking change**: enteredView/leftView were renamed to attached/detached.
    The old lifecycle methods will not be invoked.
  * **breaking change**: Event bindings with `@` are no longer supported.
  * **breaking change**: `@published` by default is no longer reflected as an
    attribute by default. This might break if you try to use the attribute in
    places like CSS selectors. To make it reflected back to an attribute use
    `@PublishedProperty(reflect: true)`.

#### Pub version 0.10.1
  * Reduce the analyzer work by mocking a small subset of the core libraries.

#### Pub version 0.10.0+1
  * Better error message on failures in pub-serve/pub-build when pubspec.yaml
    is missing or has a wrong configuration for the polymer transformers.

#### Pub version 0.10.0
  * Interop with polymer-js elements now works.
  * Polymer polyfills are now consolidated in package:web_components, which is
    identical to platform.js from http://polymer-project.org.
  * The output of pub-build no longer uses mirrors. We replace all uses of
    mirrors with code generation.
  * **breaking change**: Declaring a polymer app requires an extra import to
    `<link rel="import" href="packages/polymer/polymer.html">`
  * **breaking change**: "noscript" polymer-elements are created by polymer.js,
    and therefore cannot be extended (subtyped) in Dart. They can still be used
    by Dart elements or applications, however.
  * New feature: `@ObserveProperty('foo bar.baz') myMethod() {...}` will cause
    myMethod to be called when "foo" or "bar.baz" changes.
  * Updated for 0.10.0-dev package:observe and package:template_binding changes.
  * **breaking change**: @initMethod and @CustomTag are only supported on
    public classes/methods.

#### Pub version 0.9.5
  * Improvements on how to handle cross-package HTML imports.

#### Pub version 0.9.4
  * Removes unused dependency on csslib.

#### Pub version 0.9.3+3

    SDK >= 1.1.0-dev.5.0.
